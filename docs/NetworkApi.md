# **get_network**
> NetworkGet get_network()

Inspect network settings

This resource allows inspecting of the IP network settings of the MAP panel.


### Example


```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.network_get import NetworkGet
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://169.254.10.10
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://169.254.10.10"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.NetworkApi(api_client)

    try:
        # Inspect network settings
        api_response = api_instance.get_network()
        print("The response of NetworkApi->get_network:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling NetworkApi->get_network: %s\n" % e)
```



### Parameters

This endpoint does not need any parameter.

### Return type

[**NetworkGet**](NetworkGet.md)

### Authorization

[digest](../README.md#digest)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: Not defined
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**200** | Successful operation |  -  |
**401** | Unauthorized &lt;br&gt; This response code indicates that the client does not have the appropriate access rights to execute the requested action on the server. It indicates that an authorization needs to be done for the request.  |  -  |
**403** | Forbidden &lt;br&gt; A valid request was sent, but the user is not allowed to conduct the requested operation.  |  -  |
**409** | Conflict &lt;br&gt; This command code is returned when a command is not executed due to application specific reasons. The body of the error response will contain further information on why the command was not executed. This response code is also returned when a command on a list resource was issued with an “atomic” parameter. The code indicates that the execution of the command was not possible. The body of the response will contain the list of resource URLs which prevented execution of the command.  |  -  |
**414** | Response code is used if the URI exceeds the maximum supported size (255 bytes). In the context of the REST-API are intended to be kept short, but a client may increase the size of a URI by adding query parameters. String matching can be used to reduce the query length.  |  -  |
**500** | Internal Server Error  |  -  |
**503** | Service Unavailable &lt;br&gt; This response code indicates that the server is in a temporary overload condition and thus unable to serve the request. The client can retry the request at a later point in time.  |  -  |
